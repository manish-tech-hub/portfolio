    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm <strong>Manish Pasman</strong> â€” a passionate self-taught web developer from Nepal.
      I specialize in building dynamic  web applications using both 
      <strong> Python Django</strong> and the <strong>MERN stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy developing everything from RESTful APIs and admin dashboards. 
      My projects reflect a strong focus on clean code, efficient backend logic, and user-friendly designs.
      I'm eager to collaborate, learn, and grow as I continue my journey into the professional tech world.
    </p>
